# Exercise 1: Lists

# Create a vector of everything you ate for breakfast
breakfeast <- c("eggs","turkey", "string cheese")


# Create a vector of everything you ate for lunch
lunch <- c("yogurt", "salom")


# Create a list "meals" that has contains your `breakfast` and `lunch`
meals <- list(breakfeast = breakfeast, lunch = lunch )


# Add a "dinner" element to your "meals" list that has what you plan to eat for dinner
meals$dinner = c("tacos", "french fries")
dinner <- meals$dinner


# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
meals[['lunch']]

# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason)
meals[5] <- meals[['lunch']]



# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early.meals`



### Bonus ###
# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function


# Write a function that adds pizza to every meal


# Add pizza to every meal!
